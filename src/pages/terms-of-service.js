                            the provisions of these Terms or the Supplementary Terms. The registration, use, protection

                            attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief
                            benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. The arbitration provisions set forth
                            in this Section will survive termination of these Terms. Arbitration Rules. The arbitration
                            shall be subject to the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce

                            Section X. The arbitration will be administered by the International Court of Arbitration of
                            the ICC. Unless the parties agree otherwise, there shall be only one arbitrator appointed in
                            accordance with the ICC Rules. Any arbitration will be conducted in the English language,
                            unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union or any
                            other jurisdiction. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the
                            arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential
                            findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. <strong>JUDGMENT
